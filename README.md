Aye captain ‚öìÔ∏è
=======

Aye captain ‚öì is a tool for automating generation of release notes from Jira tickets.

The tool takes in CSV file as input exported from Jira and the platform type of the tickets currently
Android ü§ñ and iOS üçé is supported [but other platforms can be easily extended].

It can also announce on your behalf to Slack Channels you configure.

Usage when use Aye.kts
-----  

```
$  kotlin Aye.kts <path-to-csv-file.csv> <platform>

Example:

$  kotlin Aye.kts ./sample.csv Android

====================

Output:

Changes
‚ú® AJ-2013 	 Ship adaptive icon
‚ú® AJ-1995 	 Improve app startup time

Instrumentation
üìà AJ-1974 	 Add analytics event for app usage

```

Usage when we need to announce to the Slack Channels
-----  

```
$  kotlin slack.main.kts <path-to-csv-file.csv> <path-to-webhook-csv-file> <platform>

Example:

$  kotlin slack.main.kts sample.csv webhooksUrl.csv android   


====================

Output:

kotlin slack.main.kts sample.csv webhooksUrl.csv android
Changes

Instrumentation
